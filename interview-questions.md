## Intern/Entry Level Interview Questions
Intern/Entry level interviews typically aren't as difficult interviews compared to security engineers and tier 2/3 security analyst interviews. During these interviews, the hiring manager is looking to see if you understand basic network and security fundamentals. Questions asked in these interviews are typically straightforward with few scenario-based questions. During this stage in your career, it's extremely important that you showcase your willingness to learn. You will accomplish this by talking about how you are keeping up with cyber security news, homelabs you have built(don't worry, I'll create a repository for homelabs as well), and how you are contributing to the security community (this is a major bonus).
