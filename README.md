# cybersecurity-interview-questions
The purpose of this repository is to prepare you for your upcoming cybersecurity interview. I have been in the cybersecurity for 6+ year as a full time employee and 8+ years with the combination of internships and full time experience. I have completed many interviews, with me not doing so good in some interviews & me doing extremely well in others. 

The idea of this repository isn't to necessarily give you the answers to the interview questions, but to guide you to understand why these questions are being asked and how to answer them. The respository will consist of interview tips, interview styles, interview questions filtered into their perspective domain.

Hope you enjoy!!!
